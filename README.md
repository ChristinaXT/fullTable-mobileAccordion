I used JavaScript for all of the logic of the accordion - and I did that code (mobile code) first.

Then, I took on adding the desktop coding for the tabs. I debated if I wanted to this with mostly JavaScript, because I knew it would be a lot of what looks like repetitive code, but after a lot of trials, for functionality, this did turn out to be the best option.

I decided to use querySelectors

I followed all the rules: no plugins or frameworks. 

## Rules
* It's very important to match the design. This component came out of a project and is indicative of the type of work you'll encounter.
* JavaScript must be used for the accordion and tab logic.
* JavaScript must be hand coded using Vanilla ES6+.
* Please do not use any JavaScript plugins, frameworks, or libraries (React, jQuery, Lodash, etc.).
* Must work bug-free on iOS, Android, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.
* If you choose to use some sort of CLI compilation, include a compiled folder so that the HTML file can be dragged directly into the browser.
* Upload a zip file to Dropbox, Google Drive, or any other semi private storage service. Please do not post this on a public site/repository such as CodePen or GitHub.

## Bonus
* Write modular JavaScript.
* Add CSS transitions to accordion and tab events.
* Create accordion + and - icons with pure CSS.

## Design Notes
* Font used is Open Sans Regular and Bold.
* Tablet/Desktop views should account for any viewport width greater than 767px.
* If you do not have Sketch, either download a trial version or view the attached JPGs for reference.
